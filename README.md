he Contacts Manager is a small web application built using Python and Flask that allows users to organize and manage their personal or professional contacts in one place. The app provides a simple interface where users can add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, and email, and then view all their saved contacts in a structured list. Each contact can be edited or deleted at any time, making the application fully functional for basic contact management. All data is handled through Flask routes and templates, ensuring smooth interaction between the backend and the user interface. The project demonstrates essential concepts like form handling, dynamic routing, data storage, and CRUD operations in Flask, making it a useful beginner-friendly application for understanding backend development.
